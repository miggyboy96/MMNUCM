## Question 1

# c
For a new disease. Everyone is vulnerable. Individual either gets infected and dies/recovers; or gets vaccinated which prevents infection.

new group V

dV/dt = v

Susceptible individuals get vaccinated at a constant rate.

dS/dt = -beta(IS/N) - v

Effects of vaccination
Imagine that the population suddenly became aware of the epidemic that had just begun, and a vaccination programme is started. In this case, a susceptible individual can now be vaccinated, preventing them from becoming infected. Assuming that clinics have sufficient manpower and supply of vaccines, vaccination occurs at a constant rate \mu.

We can see from the figure that increasing vaccination rate \mu is vital to reducing the number of deaths over the epidemic. This is unlike the effect of decreasing infection rate \beta, which slows the death rate, since the death count eventually is the same regardless.
